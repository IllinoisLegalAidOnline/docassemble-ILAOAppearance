  Lawsuit information
subquestion: |
  If you received a Complaint and Summons, you have been sued. You need to tell the court you want to participate in your case. In some cases, you need to file an **{Answer :question-circle:}** to respond to the Complaint.
  
  If you do respond, you can be found in default, and the court can rule against you. In some cases, like evictions, you do not need to file an Appearance. Instead, you can attend your court hearing.
